# Computer-Vision-Based-Bone-Fracture-Detection-Using-Detectron2

Machine Learning Model Development: Trained Faster R-CNN models with ResNeXt-101 FPN and ResNet-50 FPN backbones using Detectron2 for bone fracture detection in hand X-ray medical images.
Dataset Preparation: Utilized Roboflow to convert and annotate medical images into COCO format, ensuring robust dataset management.
Training & Evaluation: Employed extensive training with 2000 epochs, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and used COCOEvaluator for model performance assessment. Achieved classification accuracies of 0.9683 for ResNeXt-101 FPN and 0.9619 for ResNet-50 FPN
